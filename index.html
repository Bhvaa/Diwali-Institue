        <br>
        <p>Diwali (English: /dɪwɑli/; Deepavali[3], IAST: Dīpāvalī) is the Hindu festival

            It symbolises the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, 
            and knowledge over ignorance".[4][5][6][7] Diwali is celebrated during the

            and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his 
            kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana 
            after defeating the demon king Ravana.[14] It is also widely associated 
            with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and 
            the remover of obstacles.[15] Other regional traditions connect the holiday
